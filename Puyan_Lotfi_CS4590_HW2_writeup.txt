// Write up:
//
// So a few of the things that I have 
// incorporated into my ChucK program are:
//
// - Three different instruments:
// 
// 	- Mandolin
// 	- Sitar
// 	- FLute
//
// - Envelop function:
//
// 	- I took the example code with the spork,
// 	  worked from there. 
// 	- Basically I made it increase the gain
// 	  with the increment in the for loop
// 	  and I divide the note dur with some
// 	  random function. 
//
// - Other addons:
// 
// 	- I added some mouse listener events
// 	  that bassically play the flute and 
// 	  the mandolin when the mouse is clicked
// 	  and play the sitar when the mouse is draged about.
//
// Basically there is a neat exploding sound when you click
// the mouse button (cause of the flute dragging on and the 
// increase in gain in the mandolin from the envelop/spork)
// and very precise sitar sounds when you drag. If you drag
// a lot, it will sound garbled. Best thing is to experiment
// a little with how to move the mouse and how often to click 
// the buttons, until you figure out what sounds cool.
// 
// And that is all I have to say about that...
